# Meta_programming_in_Python
Meta programming in Python creates code that can manipulate or generate other code using tools like decorators, metaclasses, and code generation libraries. It's useful for dynamic class creation, code generation, and extending code behavior. GitHub supports Python and is a great resource for developers interested in meta programming.
